Screenshots Instructions
======================

For the ADO Inventory Tool presentation, the following screenshots would be helpful:

1. Tool Output Examples:
   - Save a screenshot of the CSV output file (ado_repos_*.csv) as "repos_csv.png"
   - Save a screenshot of the JSON compliance report (ado_compliance_*.json) as "compliance_json.png"
   - Save a screenshot of the summary report (ado_summary_*.json) as "summary_json.png"

2. Command Line Examples:
   - Save a screenshot of the tool running with the --help flag as "help_command.png"
   - Save a screenshot of the tool running with compliance report generation as "running_tool.png"

3. Risk Assessment Examples:
   - Save a screenshot of a sample compliance score visualization as "compliance_score.png"
   - Save a screenshot of a risk distribution chart as "risk_distribution.png"

All screenshots should:
- Be clear and readable
- Have sensitive information redacted
- Be sized appropriately for the presentation (1280x720 or similar resolution)
- Be saved in PNG format for best quality

If you don't have actual screenshots available:
- Use placeholder images
- Create mockups using design tools
- Modify the presentation to use text descriptions instead
