Workflow Diagram Instructions
===========================

For the ADO Inventory Tool workflow diagram:

1. Create a simple workflow diagram showing these three steps:
   - Data Collection: Scan repositories across ADO organizations
   - Analysis: Evaluate security coverage, ownership, and compliance
   - Reporting: Generate CSV and JSON reports for analysis

2. Save the diagram as "workflow.png" in this directory

3. Use Jefferson Health's blue color (#0077c8) for the main elements

4. The diagram will be used in the "How It Works" slide

If you don't have time to create a custom diagram, you can:
- Use a simple flowchart from a tool like draw.io, Lucidchart, or PowerPoint
- Use placeholder text in the presentation and add the diagram later
- Modify the HTML to use text-only descriptions instead of an image
